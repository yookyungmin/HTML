<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
<p>
    programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
    compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
    
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use
    it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.[14] All major web browsers have a
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
