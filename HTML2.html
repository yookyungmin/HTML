<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
JavaScript.[2]

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target = "_blank" title="css">css</a> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
